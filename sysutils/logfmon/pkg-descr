The logfmon daemon monitors a set of syslog log files and matches each
new entry against the rules defined in its configuration file. Each
rule may be tested against entries from a single file, a set of files or
from all files. Depending on the rule, a command may be executed or the
entry may be ignored. All unmatched messages are batched together and
mailed every 15 minutes, or whatever alternative time is specified in
the configuration file.
